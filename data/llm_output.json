The crepes were large and stuffed full of ingredients. The owner(?)/chef warmly greeted our family when we arrived and he was helpful in answering our questions. Combine outstanding food that is very reasonably priced with warm and friendly staff who work very hard (they open 'til 2am) and one really appreciates what they do and the outstanding experience they provide their customers.",

Very nice employees as well. I visit this place at least three times a week and recommend it all my friends! They now come across all Paris just to have the famous crepe. Also the prices there are unbeatable and they work till 2am everyday, it’s the only place you can get hot food this late at night in the area. Don’t forget to try sweet ones as well, the strawberry with nutella and whipped cream is pure joy!",

Positive side Our suite was made up of 2 bedrooms so each has its own space in a space with 2 bathrooms, the overall decor was nice. Quality breakfast and plenty of choice. Negative rating A bathroom was not cleaned properly we requested a cleaning service, The mini bar was empty and there was a smell of sewage in one of the 2 rooms. We dined 2 evenings at the restaurant, the service was quite long and each time one person had their dish a long time after the others, not great… on the other hand, the restaurant staff was very friendly. And last point Friday evening and Saturday evening is evening with music in the restaurant until late so it's good for the atmosphere less for sleeping.

We’ve loved the slightly kooky styling, nice clean rooms and great locations of the other hotels so it was a no-brainer to book in. We arrived late after a 6 hour drive and wanted a drink & something to eat before we went to bed. The bar/restaurant was busy but not full when we arrived but we were told it was a 1.5hr wait for a table. We hadn’t been offered a table at check-in or suggested we reserve one in advance so we were quite disappointed. The maitre d’ was unhelpful & unfriendly, I felt we didn’t ‘look right’ to get a table. Usually good hotels keep a couple of tables free for their hotel guests, apparently not here. Fortunately, we found a lovely little bistro (Le Papillon) just 5 mins up the road with lovely food and welcoming and friendly staff. Mama Shelter Paris East unfortunately does not ‘love you’ like the others Mamas do...I’d give it a miss unless you’re desperate.",

                    "comment": "I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. Each night I was provided a different number of hand towels. The hotel provides you one tiny bar of soap per day, which you are supposed to use on your face, body, and hair. On my second to last morning, I was using the toilet and leaned against the wall with my hand, which caused the wall in the bathroom to collapse, and it was not repaired by the end of my stay. Further, it was never even mentioned to me after I had spoken to the front desk about it. As other reviews have stated, the lighting in the hotel room was terrible. To even have a chance of seeing things properly in your room, you have to turn all of the lights, which requires you flip no less than 6 separate switches located in different parts of the room. Also as other reviewers have stated, the climate control in the room does not work well. Further, the shelf in the hotel room for suitcases was too small to accommodate my suitcase, and most normal, non-carry-on size suitcases. The drapes in the room are also poorly designed in that they let in some light where the window meets the wall. One morning as I just exited the hotel, I spat down a sewer grate near the front door and thought nothing of it. Well, apparently, one of the front desk associates or managers saw what I had done and in a fit of rage, went off on me (yelling), and told me no less than 5 times in a row what a rude, horrible, disrespectful person I am. Whether what I did could be considered offensive or not, I thought it was extremely inappropriate for a hotel employee to be treating a guest that way.",

I had to use the torch on my phone to find the light switches and the electrical sockets. I even had to use the torch on my phone to find my black handbag on the black floor in the dark room one evening. Small room almost entirely filled by the bed and a ginormous television. No desk space, and just a cheap plastic chair squeezed in at the table with the ginormous tv. Basic and ageing bathroom. On the plus side there was a microwave and a fridge, but nothing to make use of them - no cutlery, no cups or glasses, no tea or coffee. Personally I found the bed too hot. Fluffy mattress cover and big fluffy duvet combined with a hot room made the whole thing feel suffocating. Food in the restaurant tasted good but the service was incredibly slow, even though I got there early before it got busy. All in all not to my taste. Lighting and fresh air are more my cup of tea.",

                    "comment": "In summary: - No recognition of ALL status. The hotel openly acknowledges that their systems don't show ALL loyalty and so they ignore this and treat everyone poorly. - I am a diamond ALL member and none of my benefits were provided. No free drink, no welcome gift, no upgrade, no free breakfast and no late check out. I was told on three occasions that I was not entitled to breakfast despite mentioning I am diamond and having a physical confirmation on my booking saying 'free breakfast'. - The worst part of the stay was being woken up at 8am by housekeeping knocking on my door asking when I was going to leave. This hotel really succeeded in making me feel unwelcome! Apparently they do this to all customers to ensure they kick them out early and force them to pay for breakfast having been woken up unexpectedly. I gave the hotel an opportunity to make it right and provide some compensation for such a poor experience. Their response was wholly inadequate and provided no resolution. They had the audacity to suggest that if I choose to return they would give me an 'experience that meets my expectations'. Shouldn't a hotel ALWAYS provide an 'experience that meets my expectations'? This is just basic service and they should strive to provide an experience that exceeds my expectations. Instead they should be trying to get me to return to rectify the poor experience and show me that this was a rare occurrence. What is clear from their response to my complaint is that they deal with these complaints all the time and do not care about leaving people happy as they know they don’t need people to return.",
